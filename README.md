## The Problem

When someone becomes incapacitated, hospitalized, or passes away, their loved ones often struggle to access critical information like:
- Bank account details
- Insurance policies
- Important contacts
- Medical information
- Loan/liability details
- Personal wishes

**HandOver solves this** by providing a secure digital vault that automatically becomes accessible to trusted people when the owner becomes inactive.

## User Roles Explained

### 1. Owner (Vault Creator)

The Owner is someone who wants to store their critical information and share it with trusted people in case of emergency.

**What an Owner can do:**
- Create a secure knowledge vault with 6 categories
- Add trusted people (dependents) who can access their vault
- Set specific permissions (which categories each dependent can see)
- Configure inactivity period (how many days before being marked inactive)
- View audit logs of who accessed their vault

**Owner's Screens:**
| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Dashboard | Overview of vault stats, dependents count, activity status |
| Vault | View all entries organized by 6 categories |
| Add Entry | Create new vault entry with title and content |
| Edit Entry | Modify or delete existing entries |
| Dependents | List of people who can access vault when inactive |
| Add Dependent | Add a dependent by their email address |
| Settings | Update profile, set inactivity days (1-365) |
| Audit Log | Timeline of all vault activity |

### 2. Dependent (Vault Accessor)

The Dependent is someone who has been designated by an Owner to access their vault in case of emergency.

**What a Dependent can do:**
- See list of owners who added them as dependent
- See which owners are currently active or inactive
- Request access to an inactive owner's vault
- View approved vault entries (read-only)
- Track status of their access requests

**Dependent's Screens:**
| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Dashboard | List of owners who added you, their status (Active/Inactive) |
| Access Status | Track your access requests (Pending/Approved/Rejected) |
| Request Access | Submit request with reason when owner is inactive |
| View Vault | Read-only view of permitted categories (after approval) |

### 3. Admin (Platform Manager)

The Admin verifies and approves access requests to ensure security.

**What an Admin can do:**
- View all pending access requests
- Review request details (who is requesting, whose vault, reason)
- Approve or reject requests with notes
- Monitor all platform users
- View user statistics

**Admin's Screens:**
| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Dashboard | Overview stats, pending requests alert, quick actions |
| Pending Requests | List of all access requests with approve/reject buttons |
| All Users | List of all owners and dependents on the platform |

## Detailed Process Flows

### Process 1: Owner Sets Up Vault

```
Step 1: Register
├── Open app → Tap "Sign Up"
├── Enter name, email, password
├── Select role: "Owner"
└── Account created, redirected to Owner Dashboard

Step 2: Add Vault Entries
├── Go to Vault tab
├── Tap "+" button
├── Select category (Assets/Liabilities/Insurance/Contacts/Emergency/Notes)
├── Enter title and content
└── Save entry

Step 3: Add Dependents
├── Go to Dependents tab
├── Tap "+" or "Add Dependent"
├── Enter dependent's email (must be registered as Dependent)
├── Select permissions (which categories they can access)
└── Dependent is now linked

Step 4: Configure Inactivity
├── Go to Settings tab
├── Set "Inactivity Trigger" (default: 30 days)
├── This is how long before you're marked inactive
└── Save settings
```

### Process 2: Dependent Requests Access

```
Step 1: Register as Dependent
├── Open app → Tap "Sign Up"
├── Enter name, email, password
├── Select role: "Dependent"
└── Account created, redirected to Dependent Dashboard

Step 2: Wait to be Added
├── Dashboard shows "No Owners Yet"
├── Owner must add you using your email
└── Once added, owner appears in your list

Step 3: Owner Becomes Inactive
├── Owner doesn't login for 30+ days (or their configured period)
├── System marks owner as "Inactive"
├── Owner's status changes from "Active" to "Inactive" in your dashboard
└── "REQUEST" button becomes available

Step 4: Request Access
├── Tap on inactive owner → "Request Access"
├── Enter reason for requesting access
├── Submit request
└── Status changes to "Pending"

Step 5: Wait for Admin Approval
├── Admin reviews your request
├── You can check status in "Access Status" screen
├── Status will change to "Approved" or "Rejected"
└── If rejected, you can submit a new request with more details
```

### Process 3: Admin Approves Request

```
Step 1: Login as Admin
├── Use admin credentials
└── Redirected to Admin Dashboard

Step 2: Review Pending Requests
├── Dashboard shows pending count
├── Tap "Pending Requests" or the alert card
└── See list of all pending requests

Step 3: Review Request Details
├── See who is requesting (Dependent name)
├── See whose vault (Owner name)
├── Read the reason provided
└── Check if owner is truly inactive

Step 4: Make Decision
├── Tap "Approve" → Add optional note → Confirm
│   └── Dependent can now view vault
├── Tap "Reject" → Add reason → Confirm
│   └── Dependent notified, can resubmit
└── Request moves to history
```

### Process 4: Dependent Views Vault

```
After Approval:
├── Dependent's dashboard shows owner with "VIEW" button
├── Tap owner → Opens View Vault screen
├── See only permitted categories (based on owner's settings)
├── Entries are read-only (cannot edit or delete)
└── All access is logged in owner's audit trail
```

## Vault Categories

| Category | What to Store | Icon Color |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Assets** | Bank accounts, investments, property details, FDs, stocks | Green |
| **Liabilities** | Loans, EMIs, credit cards, debts | Red |
| **Insurance** | Life insurance, health insurance, vehicle insurance | Blue |
| **Contacts** | Lawyer, CA, doctor, financial advisor, emergency contacts | Purple |
| **Emergency** | Medical info, blood type, allergies, medications | Orange |
| **Notes** | Personal wishes, instructions, messages, passwords | Gray |

## Inactivity System

The inactivity system is the core security feature:

1. **Activity Tracking**: Every time an owner logs in, their "last activity" timestamp updates
2. **Inactivity Check**: System compares last activity with current time
3. **Inactivity Trigger**: If (current time - last activity) > inactivity days, owner is marked inactive
4. **Access Unlock**: Only when owner is inactive can dependents request access

**Example:**
- Owner sets inactivity to 30 days
- Owner last logged in on Jan 1
- On Jan 31 (30 days later), owner becomes "Inactive"
- Dependents can now request access
- If owner logs in on Feb 5, they become "Active" again

## Permission System

Owners have granular control over what each dependent can see:

```
Owner: Rajesh Kumar
├── Dependent: Ananya (Wife)
│   ├── Assets: ✓
│   ├── Liabilities: ✓
│   ├── Insurance: ✓
│   ├── Contacts: ✓
│   ├── Emergency: ✓
│   └── Notes: ✓ (Full access)
│
└── Dependent: Vikram (Brother)
    ├── Assets: ✗
    ├── Liabilities: ✗
    ├── Insurance: ✓
    ├── Contacts: ✓
    ├── Emergency: ✓
    └── Notes: ✗ (Limited access)
```
